# Daily Updates - 2026-02-02 & 2026-02-03

## Navigation & UI Refinement
- **Header Profile Access**: Moved Profile access from sidebar to header dropdown for better accessibility.
- **Dropdown Polish**: Added professional icons to all items in the header user dropdown (Profile, Settings, Logout).
- **Redundancy Cleanup**: Removed duplicate "Settings" links from both header and sidebar user dropdowns to simplify navigation.
- **Mobile Menu**: Prioritized "Profile" over "Settings" in the mobile drawer and ensured "Dashboard" appears first in the link list.
- **Bot Creation Flow**: Replaced the "New Bot" modal with a dedicated, focused page at `/dashboard/bots/new` to improve user experience.

## Localization & Translations
- **Centralization**: All hardcoded strings from Knowledge Base, Profile, and Navbar moved to `language-context.tsx` for consistent management.
- **Knowledge Base Tags**: Changed "Uploaded" to "File" for English labels to match industry standards.
- **Missing Keys**: Added missing Arabic and English translations for:
  - `nav.dashboard`
  - `profile.*` (First Name, Last Name, Phone, Save Changes, etc.)
  - `knowledge.type.*` (Manual, Product, File)
- **RTL Support**: Fixed directionality, text alignment, and icon orientation issues in the Profile, Knowledge Base, and Settings pages for a better Arabic experience.

## Functional Improvements
- **Auth Context Enhancements**: Added `updateUser` function to `auth-context.tsx` to handle profile updates.
- **Profile Persistence**: User profile changes now persist instantly across the UI and remain saved in the current session.
- **Bot Context Audit**: Verified that `Knowledge`, `Settings`, and `Channels` rely on the active bot.
- **Persistent Settings**: Connected "Auto Reply", "Collect Leads", and "Agent Handoff" toggles in the Settings page to the bot context.
- **Bot Dependency Guards**: Implemented "No Bot Selected" placeholders on Knowledge Base, Channels, and Settings pages to enforce the system logic.

## Documentation & APIs
- **API Audit**: Created `apis.md` documenting current Next.js API routes and planned Node.js endpoints, categorized by functionality.
- **Implementation Plan**: Updated to reflect completion of Phases 7 and 8.
- **Daily Progress Tracking**: Maintained a comprehensive log of all codebase changes.

## In Progress
- Continuous refinement of system-wide RTL directions and icon alignments.
- **RTL Switch Component**: Fixed directionality of the Switch thumb in RTL mode (now moves to the left when active).
- **Knowledge Base Refinement**: Improved card layout and toggle spacing for a cleaner Arabic interface.
- **Backend Auth Readiness**: Added "باك حقيقي" (Real Backend) integrated logic and comments to `login`, `register`, `logout`, and `refresh` routes.
- **Environment Configuration**: Set up `.env.local` placeholders for easy backend connection.
